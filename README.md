What is arPac?
</h2>
<h3>
arPac is a package manager (or, an attempt for one) for the Arduino board. It is an attempt to unify the packages that are given out to the Arduino ecosystem. It allows developers to use a source-based, USE-flag-enabled, heavily portage-based package system like PORTS (*BSD).
